# HRIS ATS (Human Resource Information System - Applicant Tracking System)

### About

HRIS ATS is a project aimed at automating the testing process for a Human Resource Information System's Applicant Tracking System (ATS). Leveraging the power of Newman, a popular automation tool, we can efficiently automate the testing of our ATS application's APIs and ensure its functionality and reliability.

### Test Automation with Newman

Automation plays a vital role in maintaining the quality and effectiveness of software systems.
